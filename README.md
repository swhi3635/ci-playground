[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/swhi3635/ci-playground.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/swhi3635/ci-playground)

Learning to leverage CircleCI to build and publish a small "Hello World!" Python Flask app within a Docker container.

If for some reason you want to test this out, I've included a docker-compose file for your convenience:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:swhi3635/ci-playground.git
cd ci-playground
docker-compose up -d
```
